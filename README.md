Vimal's Portfolio
Hello there! My name is Vimal, and I am a Full Stack Developer. This is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, skills, and professional journey.

ðŸš€ About This Project
This portfolio is built with Astro, a modern framework designed for building fast, content-focused websites. By leveraging Astro's "island architecture," the site provides a blazing-fast user experience by shipping minimal JavaScript.

âœ¨ Features
Performance-First: The website is built to be extremely fast, with a focus on quick load times and smooth navigation.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and looks great on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

Project Showcase: A dedicated section to display my work and personal projects.
